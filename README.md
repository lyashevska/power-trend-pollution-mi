# power-trend-pollution

This repository contains R code used to evaluate the statistical power to detect temporal trends in ∑25PCB concentrations in juvenile harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) from UK waters in the period 1990-2017. ∑25PCB refers to the sum of 25 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners—persistent, toxic industrial chemicals that accumulate in marine mammals. The analysis supports the development of a marine mammal-based indicator for persistent pollutants under the MSFD and OSPAR frameworks.

Using linear regression models that account for covariates such as relative body weight and latitude, the study simulates various sampling scenarios over 6- and 10-year periods to determine the minimum sampling effort required to detect meaningful trends. The code enables users to:

- Fit temporal trend models to spatially referenced pollutant data
- Simulate PCB concentration data under defined trend scenarios
- Assess power across different sampling frequencies and durations
- Generate outputs to inform marine pollutant monitoring strategies

This work informs the design of cost-effective, scientifically robust monitoring programmes for persistent organic pollutants in marine mammals.
